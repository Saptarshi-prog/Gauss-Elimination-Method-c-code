# Gauss-Elimination-Method-c-code
This repository contains the c code for Gauss elimination method.
You can find out any set of simultaneous equation using this. All you have to do is to enter the dimension of the coeffieicent matrix. Note: Suppose there are three variables x,y,z then put dimension as 3. Then you have to insert value for the augmented matrix in row-wise order. Once you have given the input you are all set to go.
